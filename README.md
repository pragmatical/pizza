# A template for starting an FFModel based enpoint

This repo contains an FFModel based implementation of an endpoint that takes in a natural language prompt and returns a structured json object for an order at a pizza/wings/drinks restaurant.
There are 3 main directories:
- endpoint - contains a fastapi rest endpoint for the ffmodel inference endpoint
- notebooks - contains jupyter notebooks to work with endpoint locally both inference and experiment, a notebook that does analysis on experiment results, and also contains a notebook that immplements a chatbot
- solution - contains the ffmodel solution

## Running the notebooks
Notebooks run and use one of 2 .env files.  There is .ffmodel.env, and .chatbot.env
The notebooks are set up to look for these .env files go in your user home dirctory, all notebooks use .ffmodel.env except for the chatbot notebook

.ffmodel.env
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your opeai base url>
```

.chatbot.env - we turn off logging so that the notebook has clean "chatbot" conversation
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your opeai base url>
FFMODEL_METRICS_ENABLED='false'
FFMODEL_LOGGING_LEVEL='ERROR'
```
