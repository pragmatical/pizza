Sunscreen: Protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays with a high SPF sunscreen. Apply it liberally and frequently throughout the day.\\n\\n3. Water shoes: The pavement around the park can get hot, so water shoes will protect your feet and provide better traction on slippery surfaces.\\n\\n4. Towel: Bring a towel to dry off after rides and to sit on while you're taking a break.\\n\\n5. Waterproof phone case: If you want to take photos or videos while you're in the water, a waterproof phone case will keep your phone safe and dry.\\n\\n6. Snacks and water: Staying hydrated and fueled up is important, so bring plenty of water and snacks to keep you going throughout the day.\\n\\n7.
